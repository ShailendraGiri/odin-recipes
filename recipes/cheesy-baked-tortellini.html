    <p>Great baked tortellini pasta with super creamy sauce that is wonderful!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package cheese tortellini</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package fresh mushrooms, stemmed and sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil; stir in tortellini and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the tortellini float to the top and the filling is hot, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain and place into a 9-inch baking pan.</li>
        <li>Heat canola oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add mushrooms and cook until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Stir butter into the pan until melted; stir in flour slowly and cook until golden, about 1 minute. Pour milk slowly into the saucepan, stirring continuously. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook until sauce begins to bubble, 7 to 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>emove saucepan from heat. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in Parmesan cheese. Pour sauce over cooked tortellini in the baking pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until sauce begins to brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
