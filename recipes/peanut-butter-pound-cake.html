    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Nutty pound cake with a crunchy topping.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups butter, softened</li>
        <li>6 eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>½ cup creamy peanut butter</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>⅓ cup finely chopped peanuts (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10-inch tube pan; line with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Combine sugar and butter in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until light and creamy. Beat in eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add vanilla extract. Beat in peanut butter slowly.</li>
        <li>Sift flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Mix into the butter mixture, a little at a time, until batter is well blended. Pour batter into the prepared tube pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 45 minutes. Sprinkle peanuts on top. Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Continue baking until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Cool cake in the pan for 10 minutes. Invert onto a wire rack and let cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
